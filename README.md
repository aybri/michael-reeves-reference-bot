# Michael Reeves Reference Bot
The title is, uh, self explanatory.

This is a fairly old Discord bot I made a while back. Whenever you say a specific thing in chat, the bot will instantly respond with a clip from one of Michael Reeves' videos that the phrase is from.

For example: If you were to send a message containing the word "cum", the bot would respond with a clip of Michael Reeves saying "Carriage Utility Mechanism".

Videos used:
 - "Carriage Utility Mechanism" and "No you can not dumbass" from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_BlNA7bBxo
